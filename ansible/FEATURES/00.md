## Goal

We need to make Ansible playbooks for easily setting up the "base configuration" of our Linux devices.  
These devices include a Raspberry Pi 5, several Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W's, and potentially other Linux-based single-board computers in the future.

Note that the Linux distro installed on the remote device is assumed to be Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) or another Debian-based distro.

Core requirements to be installed:

Ansible (of course)

Neovim, using Lua init file, treesitter and lua-rocks package manager
Zsh
Terminal apps: Tree, Ripgrep, Bat, fzf, Htop, fd-find or fd
Git
GH
Docker 
Python
    - UV
    - Pip
Tailscale
Golang
    skate ([golang app](https://github.com/charmbracelet/skate))
Headless VS Code (for tunneling into device from local VS Code instance)




Core files to be copied over:

- Zshrc file based off our local .zshrc, with minimal modifications made (for example, no need to install conda on RPi devices)
- Neovim init.lua file
- local ssh public keys to be added to authorized_keys on remote machine
- local "constants" files (colors.zsh, constants.zsh, custom_path.zsh, aliases.zsh, functions.zsh)
- local functions files like autoload_environment.zsh
